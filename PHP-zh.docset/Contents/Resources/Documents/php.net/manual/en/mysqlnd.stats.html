 <h1>Statistics</h1>

 <p class="para">
  <em class="emphasis">Using Statistical Data</em>
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  MySQL Native Driver contains support for gathering statistics on the
  communication between the client and the server. The statistics
  gathered are of two main types:
 </p>
 <ul class="itemizedlist">
  <li class="listitem">
   <p class="para">
    Client statistics
   </p>
  </li>
  <li class="listitem">
   <p class="para">
    Connection statistics
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p class="para">
  If you are using the <em>mysqli</em> extension, these
  statistics can be obtained through two API calls:
 </p>
 <ul class="itemizedlist">
  <li class="listitem">
   <p class="para">
    <span class="function"><a href="mysqli.get-client-stats.html" class="function">mysqli_get_client_stats()</a></span>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li class="listitem">
   <p class="para">
    <span class="function"><a href="mysqli.get-connection-stats.html" class="function">mysqli_get_connection_stats()</a></span>
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <blockquote class="note"><p><strong class="note">Note</strong>: 
  <p class="para">
   Statistics are aggregated among all extensions that use MySQL Native
   Driver. For example, when compiling both <em>ext/mysql</em>
   and <em>ext/mysqli</em> against MySQL Native Driver, both
   function calls of <em>ext/mysql</em> and
   <em>ext/mysqli</em> will change the statistics. There is no
   way to find out how much a certain API call of any extension that has
   been compiled against MySQL Native Driver has impacted a certain
   statistic. You can configure the PDO MySQL Driver,
   <em>ext/mysql</em> and <em>ext/mysqli</em> to
   optionally use the MySQL Native Driver. When doing so, all three
   extensions will change the statistics.
  </p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p class="para">
  <em class="emphasis">Accessing Client Statistics</em>
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  To access client statistics, you need to call
  <span class="function"><a href="mysqli.get-client-stats.html" class="function">mysqli_get_client_stats()</a></span>. The function call does
  not require any parameters.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  The function returns an associative array that contains the name of
  the statistic as the key and the statistical data as the value.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  Client statistics can also be accessed by calling the
  <span class="function"><a href="function.phpinfo.html" class="function">phpinfo()</a></span> function.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  <em class="emphasis">Accessing Connection Statistics</em>
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  To access connection statistics call
  <span class="function"><a href="mysqli.get-connection-stats.html" class="function">mysqli_get_connection_stats()</a></span>. This takes the
  database connection handle as the parameter.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  The function returns an associative array that contains the name of
  the statistic as the key and the statistical data as the value.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  <em class="emphasis">Buffered and Unbuffered Result Sets</em>
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  Result sets can be buffered or unbuffered. Using default settings,
  <em>ext/mysql</em> and <em>ext/mysqli</em> work
  with buffered result sets for normal (non prepared statement) queries.
  Buffered result sets are cached on the client. After the query
  execution all results are fetched from the MySQL Server and stored in
  a cache on the client. The big advantage of buffered result sets is
  that they allow the server to free all resources allocated to a result
  set, once the results have been fetched by the client.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  Unbuffered result sets on the other hand are kept much longer on the
  server. If you want to reduce memory consumption on the client, but
  increase load on the server, use unbuffered results. If you experience
  a high server load and the figures for unbuffered result sets are
  high, you should consider moving the load to the clients. Clients
  typically scale better than servers. "<span class="quote">Load</span>" does not only
  refer to memory buffers - the server also needs to keep other
  resources open, for example file handles and threads, before a result
  set can be freed.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  Prepared Statements use unbuffered result sets by default. However,
  you can use <span class="function"><a href="mysqli-stmt.store-result.html" class="function">mysqli_stmt_store_result()</a></span> to enable
  buffered result sets.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  <em class="emphasis">Statistics returned by MySQL Native
  Driver</em>
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  The following tables show a list of statistics returned by the
  <span class="function"><a href="mysqli.get-client-stats.html" class="function">mysqli_get_client_stats()</a></span> and
  <span class="function"><a href="mysqli.get-connection-stats.html" class="function">mysqli_get_connection_stats()</a></span> functions.

       mysqlnd allocates an internal command/network buffer of
       <em>mysqlnd.net_cmd_buffer_size</em>
       (<var class="filename">php.ini</var>) bytes for every connection. If a
       MySQL Client Server protocol command, for example,
       <em>COM_QUERY</em> (normal query), does not fit into
       the buffer, mysqlnd will grow the buffer to what is needed for
       sending the command. Whenever the buffer gets extended for one
       connection <em>command_buffer_too_small</em> will be
       incremented by one.
      </p>

      <p class="para">
       If mysqlnd has to grow the buffer beyond its initial size of
       <em>mysqlnd.net_cmd_buffer_size</em>
       (<var class="filename">php.ini</var>) bytes for almost every connection,
       you should consider to increase the default size to avoid
       re-allocations.
      </p>

      <p class="para">
       The default buffer size is 2048 bytes in PHP 5.3.0. In future
       versions the default will be 4kB or larger. The default can
       changed either through the <var class="filename">php.ini</var> setting
       <em>mysqlnd.net_cmd_buffer_size</em> or using
       <em>mysqli_options(MYSQLI_OPT_NET_CMD_BUFFER_SIZE, int
       size)</em>.
      </p>

      <p class="para">
       It is recommended to set the buffer size to no less than 4096
       bytes because mysqlnd also uses it when reading certain
       communication packet from MySQL. In PHP 5.3.0, mysqlnd will not
       grow the buffer if MySQL sends a packet that is larger than the
       current size of the buffer. As a consequence mysqlnd is unable to
       decode the packet and the client application will get an error.
       There are only two situations when the packet can be larger than
       the 2048 bytes default of
       <em>mysqlnd.net_cmd_buffer_size</em> in PHP 5.3.0: the
       packet transports a very long error message or the packet holds
       column meta data from <em>COM_LIST_FIELD</em>
       (<span class="function"><a href="function.mysql-list-fields.html" class="function">mysql_list_fields()</a></span>) and the meta data comes
       from a string column with a very long default value (&gt;1900
       bytes). No bug report on this exists - it should happen rarely.
      </p>

      <p class="para">
       As of PHP 5.3.2 mysqlnd does not allow setting buffers smaller
       than 4096 bytes.
