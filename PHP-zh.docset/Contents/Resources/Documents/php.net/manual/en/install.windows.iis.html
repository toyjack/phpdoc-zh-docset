After having recently gone through a long process of trial and error installing both php4 and php5 on a single machine under IIS. I eventually did get it working so I thought I'd share what I learnt.<br />
<br />
Basically, as far as I can tell there is no way to get both versions working using the ISAPI dlls unfortunately. You can however get them working using one as ISAPI and the other as CGI. And probably both as CGI too, although I didn't try that.<br />
<br />
You'll need to know how to do a manual install of PHP anyway, see the instructions for how to do that. Make sure you follow the steps about your PATH env variable and Allowing extensions on IIS 6. Keep your php.inis in the relevant php directory and make sure they are not in your windows or system32 folders. And all that other hoopla.<br />
<br />
The crucial part is your php.ini files. The problem being that both versions will look at your PHPRC setting and get the ini file path from that. So you'll end up with both versions running off the same INI which is no good. The way around this is to use the CGI for one version and ISAPI for the other.<br />
<br />
The ISAPI dll never seems to look in it's own directory for the ini file, but the CGI exe does. You can use that quirk to your advantage by naming the INI file for the ISAPI version 'php-isapi.ini' and setting the PHPRC environment variable to that path. Then for the CGI version keep the php.ini in the same directory as php.exe.<br />
<br />
Then set your virtual server to use either the ISAPI module for one version, or the CGI module for the other version, and it should work. Test using phpinfo() to ensure each version is getting it's ini file from the correct place.<br />
<br />
Basically it seems that the ISAPI module will look in the path set in PHPRC first, and choose the php-isapi.ini file. The CGI module will look in PHPRC first too, but it upon seeing no php.ini it will then move on to search it's own directory, where it finds php.ini.</span>

PROBLEM<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PHP $DOCUMENT_ROOT was not set in IIS.&nbsp; <br />
ANALYSIS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Google search turned up a suggestion re using ISAPI instead of CGI.&nbsp; <br />
SOLUTION<br />
I did the fix per these suggested steps from Google search: <br />
1 Downloaded PHP5 zip<br />
2 Added ISAPI filter PHP5ISAPI.DLL named PHP<br />
3 Changed document type .php to point at the PHP5ISAPI.DLL file instead of PHP.EXE.<br />
RESULT<br />
This worked - the php pages started picking up $DOCUMENT_ROOT as expected.<br />
General suggestion: Don't waste time with CGI, use ISAPI.</span>

PHP 5, IIS 5, Win XP: <br />
<br />
One thing to note: if you run phpinfo() and the 'Configuration File (php.ini) Path' points to a directory and not the actual file (ie. C:\\windows instead of C:\\windows\\php.ini) this means that it is not using your php.ini file, it is using default settings. <br />
<br />
After spending hours searching forums the only thing that got it to work for me was to create a new environment system variable called 'PHPRC' and set it to the path where your php.ini is located (ie C:\\PHP) - simply adding C:\\PHP to the system path variable didn't do it. You have to reboot after this change of course. I'm not sure why this isn't more documented as from my searching there are quite a few people who experience this problem... hope this helps!</span>

<br />
When installing PHP 5 on IIS 6.0 and Windows 2003 I encountered problems with this instruction. I&nbsp; believe the root cause is that IIS requires the "scripts and executables" execute permission to be selected if the script engine has a .exe extension. <br />
<br />
However, there may have been additional problems. Even when selecting the "scripts and executables" execute permission I continually received HTTP Header errors. The resolution was to follow the instructions for use of php5isapi.dll. The .dll extension can be run with the "scripts only" execute permission. Also remember IIS 6.0 requires that you identify Web Extensions and Allow execution of those extensions.</span>

1. In IIS Admin, go to Application Pools<br />

There's a bug in IIS 5.1 which may prevent you from adding an Application Extension Mapping. If the OK button remains disabled after you've entered the Executable and the Extension, try this workaround provided by Microsoft:<br />
<br />
1. Right-click the individual Web site or the Web Sites folder, and then click Properties.<br />
2. On the Home Directory tab, click Configuration.<br />
3. Under Application Configuration, click Add, and then click the Mappings tab.<br />
4. With the Add/Edit Application Extension Mapping dialog box open, click Browse to select the .exe file or the .dll file from the local path on the Web server. <br />
<br />
Note: <br />
You must type the path to a valid file in the Executable text box or the OK button remains unavailable. The easiest way to make sure that you enter a valid path is to select the file by using the Browse button.<br />
<br />
5. After the path appears in the Executable text box, click in the Executable text box to initialize the path.<br />
<br />
6. Click in the Extension space, and then type the file name extension.<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
- You must enter the period (.) in front of the extension in the Extension text box, or the OK button remains unavailable.<br />
<br />
7. When the OK button becomes active, click OK to continue.<br />

If you use IIS6 you have to add a new Webextension for PHP to work, otherwise you will get a "404"-Page if you try to point your browser to a "*.php" file.<br />
In order to do this you have to open the IIS-management console and open the "local computer".<br />
Under "webextensions" you will find allready a list with different extensions all being blocked by default.<br />
To get PHP to work you have to manually add a new webextension. I only have a german version of IIS in front of me so forgive me if i translate the buttons wrongly.<br />
Click on "New webextension". Enter any name you like for your new extension. Click on "Add..." and then on "Search...". If you would like to add the DLL just browse to your PHP-directory and you will find the php5ts.dll. If you search for the php-cgi.exe you have to change the filetype at the bottom to "CGI-Exe-Files". Only after changing the filetype you can see the php-cgi.exe file and choose it for the extension.<br />
If you check the checkbox at the bottom of the "New extension" Window it will allow the newly added extension to be executed. Certainly you can change the status any time you want by clicking on "Allow".<br />
Only after that procedure you will be able to get in touch with PHP-files.<br />

Ofcourse you can add other pages as default.<br />
<br />
For those that do not know what is this for: If you do not provide full URL and you have several pages in the directory which are in this list, the server will return the topmost of them. In case you wish to open other page of them, you have to provide its full URL. Putting "index.php" on top will make sure no other pages will be returned as default.</span>

I am running Active Directory &amp; IIS6.0<br />
<br />
I found that after looking through the tutorial below i was still unable to get into my site (authentication popup, 401.3 error). I set my permissions for read &amp; execute for IUSR_(server) and IIS_WPG for both my document root and the php directory.. no luck.<br />
<br />
However, here's how i solved the problem. (I believe this solution is relevant to fixing the active directory issue)<br />
<br />
1. You want to give the IUSR_* and IIS_WPG read &amp; execute permission to the PHP DIRECTORY ONLY. (I managed to remove the credentials from my document root and it still works.<br />
<br />
2. Open IIS Manager and go to Application Pools, then to the pool which is relevant to your site (in my case DefaultAppPool).. on this item, right click and choose properties.<br />
<br />
3. Now navigate to the identity tab.<br />
<br />
4. My Worker process was set to Predefined: Network Service. I changed this to Configurable: IWAM_(server name) (which if you noticed is in the user group 'IIS_WPG')<br />
<br />
Note: i also changed the passwords for my IUSR_* and IWAM_* accounts to be sure they werent set to something easy by default. Its probably a good idea to do this too.<br />
<br />
Hope this solves someones frustration.</span>

&nbsp;I got PHP working by using one of the tips above (thanks!).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I noted however, that I did not need to 'allow unknown Isapi applications' , and I was able to keep the configuration at 'Scripts Only' instead of 'Scripts and Executables'&nbsp; - both settings are potentially more secure this way.<br />

The only configuration that is different from how I normally configure PHP on IIS 5 is the addition of PHP as a Web Service Extension.</span>

Here's a quick fyi, to get PHP installed on .Net Server w/ IIS 6 you have to use the IIS manager to enable support for different web service extentions. CGI ,ASP, ISAPI are all prohibited by default. In IIS manager click on the Web Service Extentions Folder there's options to add a new extention , prohibit all extentions etc. I chose add new extention ,in the dialog box I named it PHP , click add , in the next dialog browse to path of 'php4isapi.dll' hit ok then mark checkbox "Set extention status Allowed"&nbsp; hit ok and all is good. This was done after I followed the install.txt for IIS 4 or newer .</span>
