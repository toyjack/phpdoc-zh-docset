            XA/Distributed transactions can spawn multiple MySQL servers.
            Thus, they may seem like a perfect
            tool for sharded MySQL clusters, for example, clusters managed with MySQL Fabric.
            <em>PECL/mysqlnd_ms</em> hides most of the SQL commands
            to control XA transactions and performs automatic administrative tasks in cases
            of errors, to provide the user with a comprehensive API. Users should
            setup the plugin carefully and be well aware of server restrictions prior
            to using the feature.

        <p class="para">
            XA transactions use the two-phase commit protocol. The two-phase commit
            protocol is a blocking protocol. During the first phase participating servers
            begin a transaction and the client carries out its work. This phase is followed
            by a second voting phase. During voting, the servers first make a firm promise
            that they are ready to commit the work even in case of their possible unexpected
            failure. Should a server crash in this phase, it will still recall the aborted
            transaction after recover and wait for the client to decide on whether
            it shall be committed or rolled back.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Should a client that has initiated a global transaction crash after all the
            participating servers gave their promise to be ready to commit, then the servers
            must wait for a decision. The servers are not allowed to uniliterally decide on the
            transaction.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            A client crash or disconnect from a participant, a server crash or server error
            during the fist phase of the protocol is uncritical. In most cases, the server
            will forget about the XA transaction and its work is rolled back. Additionally,
            the plugin tries to reach out to as many participants as it can to instruct
            the server to roll back the work immediately. It is not possible to disable this implicit
            rollback carried out by <em>PECL/mysqlnd_ms</em> in case of errors
            during the first phase of the protocol. This design decision has been made to
            keep the implementation simple.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            An error during the second phase of the commit protocol can develop into a
            more severe situation. The servers will not forget about
            prepared but unfinished transactions in all cases. The plugin will not
            attempt to solve these cases immediately but waits for optional background
            garbage collection to ensure progress of the commit protocol. It is assumed
            that a solution will take significant time as it may include waiting
            for a participating server to recover from a crash. This time span may
            be longer than a developer and end user expects when trying to commit a
            global transaction with <span class="function"><a href="function.mysqlnd-ms-xa-commit.html" class="function">mysqlnd_ms_xa_commit()</a></span>. Thus,
            the function returns with the unfinished global transaction still
            requiring attention. Please, be warned that at this point, it is not yet
            clear whether the global transaction will be committed or rolled back later on.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Errors during the second phase can be ignored, handled by yourself or solved
            by the build-int garbage collection logic. Ignoring them is not recommended
            as you may experience unfinished global transactions on your servers that block
            resources virtually indefinetly. Handling the errors requires knowing the
            participants, checking their state and issueing appropriate SQL commands on them.
            There are no user API calls to expose this very information. You will have to
            configure a state store and make the plugin record its actions in it to receive
            the desired facts.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Please, see the
            <a href="mysqlnd-ms.quickstart.xa_transactions.html" class="link">quickstart</a> and
            related <a href="mysqlnd-ms.plugin-ini-json.html#ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.xa.state-store" class="link">plugin
            configuration file settings</a> for an example how to configure a state.
            In addition to configuring a state store, you have to setup some SQL tables.
            The table definitions are given in the description of the plugin configuration
            settings.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Setting up and configuring a state store is also a precondition for using the
            built-in garbage collection for XA transactions that fail during the
            second commit phase. Recording information about ongoing XA transactions is
            an unavoidable extra task. The extra task consists of updating the state
            store after each and every operation that changes the state of the global transaction
            itself (started, committed, rolled back, errors and aborts), the addition of
            participants (host, optionally user and password required to connect) and any
            changes to a participants state. Please note, depending on configuration and your
            security policies, these recordings may be considered sensitive.
            It is therefore recommended to restrict access to the state store. Unless the
            state store itself becomes overloaded, writing the state information may contribute
            noteworthy to the runtime but should overall be only a minor factor.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            It is possible that the effort it takes to implement your own routines for handling
            XA transactions that failed during the second commit phase exceeds the benefits
            of using the XA feature of <em>PECL/mysqlnd_ms</em> in the first place.
            Thus, the manual focussed on using the built-on garbage collection only.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Garbage collection can be triggered manually or automatically in the background.
            You may want to call <span class="function"><a href="function.mysqlnd-ms-xa-gc.html" class="function">mysqlnd_ms_xa_gc()</a></span> immediately after
            a commit failure to attempt to solve any failed but still open global transactions
            as soon as possible. You may also decide to disable the automatic background
            garbage collection, implement your own rule set for invoking the built-in
            garbage collection and trigger it when desired.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            By default the plugin will start the garbage collection with a certain probability
            in the extensions internal <em>RSHUTDOWN</em> method. The request
            shutdown is called after your script finished. Whether the garbage collection
            will be triggered is determined by computing a random value between
            <em>1...1000</em> and comparing it with the configuration setting
            <a href="mysqlnd-ms.plugin-ini-json.html#ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.xa.gc" class="link"><em>probability</em></a>
            (default: 5). If the setting is
            greater or equal to the random value, the garbage collection will be triggered.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Once started, the garbage collection acts upon up to
            <em>max_transactions_per_run</em> (default: 100) global transactions
            recorded. Records include successfully finished but also unfinished XA
            transactions. Records for successful transactions are removed and unfinished
            transactions are attempted to be solved. There are no statistics that help
            you finding the right balance between keeping garbage collection runs short
            by limiting the number of transactions considered per run and preventing the garbage
            collection to fall behind, resulting in many records.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            For each failed XA transaction the garbage collection makes
            <em>max_retries</em> (default: 5) attempts to finish it. After that
            <em>PECL/mysqlnd_ms</em> gives up. There are two possible reasons for this. Either
            a participating server crashed and has not become accessible again within
            <em>max_retries</em> invocations of the garbage collection, or there
            is a situation that the built-in garbage collection cannot cope with. Likely, the
            latter would be considered a bug. However, you can manually force more
            garbage collection runs calling <span class="function"><a href="function.mysqlnd-ms-xa-gc.html" class="function">mysqlnd_ms_xa_gc()</a></span> with the
            appropriate parameter set. Should even those function runs fail to solve
            the situation, then the problem must be solved by an operator.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            The function <a href="function.mysqlnd-ms-get-stats.html" class="link"><span class="function"><a href="function.mysqlnd-ms-get-stats.html" class="function">mysqlnd_ms_get_stats()</a></span></a>
            provides some statistics on how many XA transactions have been started,
            committed, failed or rolled back.
