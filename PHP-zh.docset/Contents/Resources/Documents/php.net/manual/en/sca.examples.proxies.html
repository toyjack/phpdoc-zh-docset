  <h2 class="title"> Obtaining a proxy for another Service Component </h2>
  <p class="para">
   One SCA component can call the service provided by another SCA
   component. The service a component provides is made up of all of its
   public methods. SCA for PHP currently provides two ways for one
   component to call another: either locally (i.e. within the same PHP
   run-time, and on the same call stack) or remotely if the called
   component exposes a Web service binding. 
  </p>
  
  <p class="para">
   In order for one component to call another, the calling
   component needs a proxy for the called component. This proxy is
   usually provided as an instance variable in the calling component,
   though proxies can also be obtained with the SCA::getService()
   call, as we shall see later. When a component is constructed,
   proxies are constructed for any instance variable which refer to
   another component, and these proxies are &quot;injected&quot; into the
   instance variables. Proxies are always used, whether the
   component is local or remote, in order to provide identical calling
   behavior between remote and local calls (for example, local calls
   are made to always pass data by-value). The proxies know how to
   locate the required component and to pass the calls made on to them.
  </p>
  
  <p class="para">
   Instance variables which are intended to hold proxies for
   services are indicated by the two PHPDocumentor-style
   annotations, @reference and @binding. Both annotations are
   placed in the documentation section for a class instance variable,
   as shown by the code below. 
  </p>
  
  <p class="para">
   The @reference annotation before an instance variable
   indicates that the instance variable is to be initialized with a
   proxy to a component. 
  </p>
  
  <p class="para"> 
   The @binding annotation has two forms @binding.php and
   @binding.soap, and indicates that the proxy is either for a local
   component or for a Web service respectively. For both @binding.php
   and @binding.soap, the annotation gives a target URI. 
  </p>
  
  <p class="para">
   At the moment, with the annotation-based method of
   specifying dependencies, the only way to alter the intended target
   of a reference is to alter the annotation within the component.
  </p>
  
  <p class="para">
   In our ConvertedStockQuote example, the
   <var class="varname"><var class="varname">$exchange_rate</var></var> instance variable will be
   initialized with a proxy to the local ExchangeRate component
   whenever an instance of the ConvertedStockQuote is constructed.

  <p class="para"> 
   For @binding.php, the URI identifies the location of the
   script containing the implementation of the component. The
   component will be called locally. The service provided is the set of
   public methods of the component. The URI must be a simple pathname,
   either absolute or relative. The component will be loaded with the
   PHP include directive, after testing to see if it is already loaded
   with
   <span class="function"><a href="function.class-exists.html" class="function">class_exists()</a></span>. If the URI is a relative
   path, it is resolved relative to the component containing the
   annotation. Note that this is different from the normal PHP
   behaviour where scripts would be looked for along the PHP
   include_path, This is intended to provide some
   location-independence for cross-component references. 
  </p>
  
  <p class="para"> 
   If this ExchangeRate service were remote and to be called as a
   Web service, only the @binding line changes. Instead of giving the
   location of a PHP class, it gives the location of the WSDL describing
   the web service. In our example component, this is illustrated by
   the second reference:

    </div>

   </div>
  </p>
  
  <p class="para"> 
   The StockQuote component will be called via a Web service
   request. In this case the URI for the WSDL can be a simple pathname, or
   may contain a PHP wrapper and begin, for example, with
   <var class="varname"><var class="varname">file://</var></var> or
   <var class="varname"><var class="varname">http://</var></var>. In the event that it is a simple
   pathname, it can be absolute or relative, and if relative will be
   resolved relative to the component containing the annotation.
   Note that this is like the behaviour for @binding.php, and
   different from the normal PHP behaviour where the file would be
   looked for relative to the PHP current working directory, which
   would usually be the location of the first script to be called. This
   behaviour is intended to give consistency across the different
   bindings and to provide some location-independence for
   references between components.
