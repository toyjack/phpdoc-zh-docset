  <h2 class="title">错误处理</h2>
  <p class="para">
   默认情况下，错误处理应该由用户来处理，应用程序应该检查数据库函数的返回值并且
   处理其中可能产生的错误内容。例如，如果插件为一个只读查询选择了一个已经不可用
   的 slave，那么将会在执行以后产生一个错误。
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   <em class="emphasis">默认：手动处理错误</em>
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   It is up to
   the application to handle the error and, if required, re-issue the query to
   trigger the selection of another slave server for statement execution.
   The plugin will make no attempts to failover automatically, because the plugin
   cannot ensure that an automatic failover will not change the state of
   the connection. For example, the application may have issued a query
   which depends on SQL user variables which are bound to a specific connection.
   Such a query might return incorrect results if the plugin would switch the
   connection implicitly as part of automatic failover. To ensure correct
   results, the application must take care of the failover, and rebuild
   the required connection state. Therefore, by default, no automatic failover
   is performed by the plugin.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   A user that does not change the connection state after opening a connection
   may activate automatic failover. Please note, that automatic failover logic
   is limited to connection attempts. Automatic failover is not used for already
   established connections. There is no way to instruct the plugin to attempt
   failover on a connection that has been connected to MySQL already in the past.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   <em class="emphasis">Automatic failover</em>
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   The failover policy is configured in the plugins configuration file, by
   using the <a href="mysqlnd-ms.plugin-ini-json.html#ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.failover" class="link">failover</a>
   configuration directive.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Automatic and silent failover can be enabled through the
   <a href="mysqlnd-ms.plugin-ini-json.html#ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.failover" class="link">failover</a>
   configuration directive. Automatic failover can either be configured to
   try exactly one master after a slave failure or, alternatively, loop
   over slaves and masters before returning an error to the user. The number
   of connection attempts can be limited and failed hosts can be excluded
   from future load balancing attempts. Limiting the number of retries and
   remembering failed hosts are considered experimental features, albeit being
   reasonable stable. Syntax and semantics may change in future versions.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
    Please note, since version 1.5.0 automatic failover is disabled for the
    duration of a transaction if transaction stickiness is enabled and
    transaction boundaries have been detected.  The plugin will not switch
    connections for the duration of a transaction. It will also not perform
    automatic and silent failover. Instead an error  will be thrown. It is then left
    to the user to handle the failure of the transaction. Please check, the
    <a href="mysqlnd-ms.plugin-ini-json.html#ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.trx-stickiness" class="link"><em>trx_stickiness</em></a>
    documentation how to do this.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   A basic manual failover example is provided within the
   <a href="mysqlnd-ms.errorhandling.html" class="link">error handling</a> section.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   <em class="emphasis">Standby servers</em>
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Using <a href="mysqlnd-ms.plugin-ini-json.html#ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.filter-random" class="link">weighted load balancing</a>,
   introduced in PECL/mysqlnd 1.4.0, it is possible
   to configure standby servers that are sparsely used during normal operations.
   A standby server that is primarily used as a worst-case standby failover target
   can be assigned a very low weight/priority in relation to all other
   servers. As long as all servers are up and running the majority of the workload
   is assigned to the servers which have hight weight values. Few requests
   will be directed to the standby system which has a very low weight value.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Upon failure of the servers with a high priority, you can still failover to
   the standby, which has been given a low load balancing priority by assigning a low
   weight to it. Failover can be some manually or automatically. If done
   automatically, you may want to combine it with the
   <a href="mysqlnd-ms.plugin-ini-json.html#ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.failover" class="link"><em>remember_failed</em></a>
   option.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   At this point, it is not possible to instruct the load balancer to direct no
   requests at all to a standby. This may not be much of a limitation given that
   the highest weight you can assign to a server is 65535. Given two slaves,
   of which one shall act as a standby and has been assigned a weight of 1,
   the standby will have to handle far less than one percent of the overall workload.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   <em class="emphasis">Failover and primary copy</em>
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Please note, if using a primary copy cluster, such as MySQL Replication, it is
   difficult to do connection failover in case of a master failure.
   At any time there is only one master in the cluster for a given dataset.
   The master is a single point of failure. If the master fails, clients have no
   target to fail over write requests. In case of a master outage the database
   administrator must take care of the situation and update the client
   configurations, if need be.
