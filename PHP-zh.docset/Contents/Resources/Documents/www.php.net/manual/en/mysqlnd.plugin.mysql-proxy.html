  <h2 class="title">A comparison of mysqlnd plugins with MySQL Proxy</h2>
  <p class="para">
   <code class="literal">Mysqlnd</code> plugins and MySQL Proxy are different
   technologies using different approaches. Both are valid tools for
   solving a variety of common tasks such as load balancing, monitoring,
   and performance enhancements. An important difference is that MySQL
   Proxy works with all MySQL clients, whereas
   <code class="literal">mysqlnd</code> plugins are specific to PHP applications.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   As a PHP Extension, a <code class="literal">mysqlnd</code> plugin gets
   installed on the PHP application server, along with the rest of PHP.
   MySQL Proxy can either be run on the PHP application server or can be
   installed on a dedicated machine to handle multiple PHP application
   servers.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Deploying MySQL Proxy on the application server has two advantages:
  </p>
  <ol type="1">
   <li class="listitem">
    <p class="para">
     No single point of failure
    </p>
   </li>
   <li class="listitem">
    <p class="para">
     Easy to scale out (horizontal scale out, scale by client)
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="para">
   MySQL Proxy (and <code class="literal">mysqlnd</code> plugins) can solve
   problems easily which otherwise would have required changes to
   existing applications.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   However, MySQL Proxy does have some disadvantages:
  </p>
  <ul class="itemizedlist">
   <li class="listitem">
    <p class="para">
     MySQL Proxy is a new component and technology to master and deploy.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li class="listitem">
    <p class="para">
     MySQL Proxy requires knowledge of the Lua scripting language.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="para">
   MySQL Proxy can be customized with C and Lua programming. Lua is the
   preferred scripting language of MySQL Proxy. For most PHP experts Lua
   is a new language to learn. A <code class="literal">mysqlnd</code> plugin can
   be written in C. It is also possible to write plugins in PHP using
   <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/mysqlnd_uh" class="link external" title="Link : http://pecl.php.net/package/mysqlnd_uh">&raquo;&nbsp;PECL/mysqlnd_uh</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   MySQL Proxy runs as a daemon - a background process. MySQL Proxy can
   recall earlier decisions, as all state can be retained. However, a
   <code class="literal">mysqlnd</code> plugin is bound to the request-based
   lifecycle of PHP. MySQL Proxy can also share one-time computed
   results among multiple application servers. A
   <code class="literal">mysqlnd</code> plugin would need to store data in a
   persistent medium to be able to do this. Another daemon would need to
   be used for this purpose, such as Memcache. This gives MySQL Proxy an
   advantage in this case.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   MySQL Proxy works on top of the wire protocol. With MySQL Proxy you
   have to parse and reverse engineer the MySQL Client Server Protocol.
   Actions are limited to those that can be achieved by manipulating the
   communication protocol. If the wire protocol changes (which happens
   very rarely) MySQL Proxy scripts would need to be changed as well.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   <code class="literal">Mysqlnd</code> plugins work on top of the C API, which
   mirrors the <code class="literal">libmysqlclient</code> client.
   This C API is basically a wrapper around the MySQL Client Server
   protocol, or wire protocol, as it is sometimes called. You can
   intercept all C API calls. PHP makes use of the C API, therefore you
   can hook all PHP calls, without the need to program at the level of
   the wire protocol.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   <code class="literal">Mysqlnd</code> implements the wire protocol. Plugins can
   therefore parse, reverse engineer, manipulate and even replace the
   communication protocol. However, this is usually not required.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   As plugins allow you to create implementations that use two levels (C
   API and wire protocol), they have greater flexibility than MySQL
   Proxy. If a <code class="literal">mysqlnd</code> plugin is implemented using
   the C API, any subsequent changes to the wire protocol do not require
   changes to the plugin itself.
