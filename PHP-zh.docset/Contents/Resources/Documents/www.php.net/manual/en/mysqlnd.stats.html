 <h1>Statistics</h1>

 <p class="para">
  <em class="emphasis">Using Statistical Data</em>
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  MySQL Native Driver contains support for gathering statistics on the
  communication between the client and the server. The statistics
  gathered are of two main types:
 </p>
 <ul class="itemizedlist">
  <li class="listitem">
   <p class="para">
    Client statistics
   </p>
  </li>
  <li class="listitem">
   <p class="para">
    Connection statistics
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p class="para">
  If you are using the <code class="literal">mysqli</code> extension, these
  statistics can be obtained through two API calls:
 </p>
 <ul class="itemizedlist">
  <li class="listitem">
   <p class="para">
    <span class="function"><a href="function.mysqli-get-client-stats.html" class="function">mysqli_get_client_stats()</a></span>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li class="listitem">
   <p class="para">
    <span class="function"><a href="mysqli.get-connection-stats.html" class="function">mysqli_get_connection_stats()</a></span>
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <blockquote class="note"><p><strong class="note">Note</strong>: 
  <p class="para">
   Statistics are aggregated among all extensions that use MySQL Native
   Driver. For example, when compiling both <code class="literal">ext/mysql</code>
   and <code class="literal">ext/mysqli</code> against MySQL Native Driver, both
   function calls of <code class="literal">ext/mysql</code> and
   <code class="literal">ext/mysqli</code> will change the statistics. There is no
   way to find out how much a certain API call of any extension that has
   been compiled against MySQL Native Driver has impacted a certain
   statistic. You can configure the PDO MySQL Driver,
   <code class="literal">ext/mysql</code> and <code class="literal">ext/mysqli</code> to
   optionally use the MySQL Native Driver. When doing so, all three
   extensions will change the statistics.
  </p>
 </p></blockquote>
 <p class="para">
  <em class="emphasis">Accessing Client Statistics</em>
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  To access client statistics, you need to call
  <span class="function"><a href="function.mysqli-get-client-stats.html" class="function">mysqli_get_client_stats()</a></span>. The function call does
  not require any parameters.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  The function returns an associative array that contains the name of
  the statistic as the key and the statistical data as the value.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  Client statistics can also be accessed by calling the
  <span class="function"><a href="function.phpinfo.html" class="function">phpinfo()</a></span> function.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  <em class="emphasis">Accessing Connection Statistics</em>
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  To access connection statistics call
  <span class="function"><a href="mysqli.get-connection-stats.html" class="function">mysqli_get_connection_stats()</a></span>. This takes the
  database connection handle as the parameter.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  The function returns an associative array that contains the name of
  the statistic as the key and the statistical data as the value.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  <em class="emphasis">Buffered and Unbuffered Result Sets</em>
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  Result sets can be buffered or unbuffered. Using default settings,
  <code class="literal">ext/mysql</code> and <code class="literal">ext/mysqli</code> work
  with buffered result sets for normal (non prepared statement) queries.
  Buffered result sets are cached on the client. After the query
  execution all results are fetched from the MySQL Server and stored in
  a cache on the client. The big advantage of buffered result sets is
  that they allow the server to free all resources allocated to a result
  set, once the results have been fetched by the client.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  Unbuffered result sets on the other hand are kept much longer on the
  server. If you want to reduce memory consumption on the client, but
  increase load on the server, use unbuffered results. If you experience
  a high server load and the figures for unbuffered result sets are
  high, you should consider moving the load to the clients. Clients
  typically scale better than servers. <q class="quote">Load</q> does not only
  refer to memory buffers - the server also needs to keep other
  resources open, for example file handles and threads, before a result
  set can be freed.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  Prepared Statements use unbuffered result sets by default. However,
  you can use <span class="function"><a href="mysqli-stmt.store-result.html" class="function">mysqli_stmt_store_result()</a></span> to enable
  buffered result sets.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  <em class="emphasis">Statistics returned by MySQL Native
  Driver</em>
 </p>
 <p class="para">
  The following tables show a list of statistics returned by the
  <span class="function"><a href="function.mysqli-get-client-stats.html" class="function">mysqli_get_client_stats()</a></span> and
  <span class="function"><a href="mysqli.get-connection-stats.html" class="function">mysqli_get_connection_stats()</a></span> functions.

      example, the parse tree to be reused during multiple statement
      executions. If you execute a prepared statement only once the two
      stage processing can be inefficient compared to
      <q class="quote">normal</q> queries because all the caching means extra
      work and it takes (limited) server resources to hold the cached
