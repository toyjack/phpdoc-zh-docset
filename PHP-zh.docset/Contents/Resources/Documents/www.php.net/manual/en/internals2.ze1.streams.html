  <h3 class="title">Overview</h3>
  <p class="para">
   The PHP Streams API introduces a unified approach to the handling of
   files and sockets in PHP extension.  Using a single API with standard
   functions for common operations, the streams API allows your extension
   to access files, sockets, URLs, memory and script-defined objects.
   Streams is a run-time extensible API that allows dynamically loaded
   modules (and scripts!) to register new streams.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   The aim of the Streams API is to make it comfortable for developers to
   open files, URLs and other streamable data sources with a unified API
   that is easy to understand.  The API is more or less based on the ANSI
   C stdio family of functions (with identical semantics for most of the main
   functions), so C programmers will have a feeling of familiarity with streams.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
    The streams API operates on a couple of different levels: at the base level,
    the API defines php_stream objects to represent streamable data sources.
    On a slightly higher level, the API defines php_stream_wrapper objects
    which &quot;wrap&quot; around the lower level API to provide support for retrieving
    data and meta-data from URLs.  An additional <em>context</em>
    parameter, accepted by most stream creation functions, is passed to the
    wrapper&#039;s <em>stream_opener</em> method to fine-tune the behavior
    of the wrapper.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Any stream, once opened, can also have any number of <em>filters</em>
   applied to it, which process data as it is read from/written to the stream.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Streams can be cast (converted) into other types of file-handles, so that they
   can be used with third-party libraries without a great deal of trouble.  This
   allows those libraries to access data directly from URL sources.  If your
   system has the <span class="function"><strong>fopencookie()</strong></span> or
   <span class="function"><strong>funopen()</strong></span> function, you can even
   pass any PHP stream to any library that uses ANSI stdio!

 <div class="sect2" id="internals2.ze1.streams.basics">
  <h3 class="title">Streams Basics</h3>
  <p class="para">
   Using streams is very much like using ANSI stdio functions.  The main
   difference is in how you obtain the stream handle to begin with.
   In most cases, you will use <span class="function"><strong>php_stream_open_wrapper()</strong></span>
   to obtain the stream handle.  This function works very much like fopen,
   as can be seen from the example below:

        char buf[1024];

  <h3 class="title">Streams as Resources</h3>
  <p class="para">
   All streams are registered as resources when they are created.  This ensures
   that they will be properly cleaned up even if there is some fatal error.
   All of the filesystem functions in PHP operate on streams resources - that
   means that your extensions can accept regular PHP file pointers as
   parameters to, and return streams from their functions.
   The streams API makes this process as painless as possible:

   Since streams are automatically cleaned up, it&#039;s tempting to think that we can get
   away with being sloppy programmers and not bother to close the streams when we
   are done with them.  Although such an approach might work, it is not a good idea
   for a number of reasons: streams hold locks on system resources while they are
   open, so leaving a file open after you have finished with it could prevent other
   processes from accessing it.  If a script deals with a large number of files,
   the accumulation of the resources used, both in terms of memory and the
   sheer number of open files, can cause web server requests to fail.  Sounds
   bad, doesn&#039;t it?  The streams API includes some magic that helps you to
   keep your code clean - if a stream is not closed by your code when it should
   be, you will find some helpful debugging information in you web server error
   log.
  </p>
  <blockquote class="note"><p><strong class="note">Note</strong>: 
   <span class="simpara">
    Always use a debug build of PHP when developing an extension
    (<strong class="option unknown">--enable-debug</strong>
 when running configure), as a lot of
    effort has been made to warn you about memory and stream leaks.
   </span>
  </p></blockquote>
  <p class="para">
   In some cases, it is useful to keep a stream open for the duration of a request,
   to act as a log or trace file for example.  Writing the code to safely clean up
   such a stream is not difficult, but it&#039;s several lines of code that are not
   strictly needed.  To save yourself the trouble of writing the code, you
   can mark a stream as being OK for auto cleanup.  What this means is
   that the streams API will not emit a warning when it is time to auto-cleanup
   a stream.  To do this, you can use <span class="function"><strong>php_stream_auto_cleanup()</strong></span>.

       If this flag is set, and there was an error during the opening of the file
       or URL, the streams API will call the php_error function for you.  This
       is useful because the path may contain username/password information
       that should not be displayed in the browser output (it would be a
       security risk to do so).  When the streams API raises the error, it first
       strips username/password information from the path, making the error

       This flag is useful when your extension really must be able to randomly
       seek around in a stream.  Some streams may not be seekable in their
       native form, so this flag asks the streams API to check to see if the
       stream does support seeking.  If it does not, it will copy the stream
       into temporary storage (which may be a temporary file or a memory
       stream) which does support seeking.
       Please note that this flag is not useful when you want to seek the
       stream and write to it, because the stream you are accessing might
       not be bound to the actual resource you requested.

      <blockquote class="note"><p><strong class="note">Note</strong>:

      <span class="simpara">
       If your extension is using a third-party library that expects a FILE* or
       file descriptor, you can use this flag to request the streams API to
       open the resource but avoid buffering.  You can then use
       <span class="function"><strong>php_stream_cast()</strong></span> to retrieve the FILE* or
       file descriptor that the library requires.

      <span class="simpara">
       Since this option disables buffering at the streams API level, you
       may experience lower performance when using streams functions
       on the stream; this is deemed acceptable because you have told
       streams that you will be using the functions to match the underlying
       stream implementation.
