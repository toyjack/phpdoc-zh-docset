  <p class="simpara">
   C is a very low-level language by modern definitions. This means that it has
   no built-in support for many features that PHP takes for granted, such as
   reflection, dynamic module loading, bounds checking, threadsafe data
   management and various useful data structures including linked lists and
   hash tables. At the same time, C is a common denominator of language support
   and functionality. Given enough work, none of these concepts are impossible;
   the Zend Engine uses them all.
  </p>

  <p class="simpara">
   A lot of effort has gone into making the Zend API both extensible and
   understandable, but C forces certain necessary declarations upon any
   extension that to an inexperienced eye seem redundant or plain unnecessary.
   All of those constructs, detailed in this section, are &quot;write once and
   forget&quot; in Zend Engine 2 and 3. Here are some excerpts from the pre-generated
   <var class="filename">php_counter.h</var> and <var class="filename">counter.c</var> files
   created by PHP 5.3&#039;s <strong class="command">ext_skel</strong>, showing the pre-generated
   declarations:

   <span class="simpara">
    The astute reader will notice that there are several declarations in the
    real files that aren&#039;t shown here. Those declarations are specific to
    various Zend subsystems and are discussed elsewhere as appropriate.

     The lines concerning <em>counter_module_entry</em> declare a
     global variable, and a macroed pointer to it, which contains the
     <em>zend_module_entry</em> for the extension. Despite the later
     discussion regarding the drawbacks of &quot;true&quot; globals, this usage is
     intentional; Zend takes precautions to avoid misusing this variable.

     <strong><code>PHP_COUNTER_API</code></strong> is declared for use by non-PHP
     functions the module intends to export for the use of other modules. The
     counter extension doesn&#039;t declare any of these, and in the final version of
     the header file, this macro has been removed. The
     <strong><code>PHPAPI</code></strong> macro is declared identically elsewhere and is
     used by the standard extension to make the <span class="function"><a href="function.phpinfo.html" class="function">phpinfo()</a></span>

     A standard list of includes, especially the extension&#039;s own

     gives the extension access to determinations made by
     <strong class="command">configure</strong>. <var class="filename">php.h</var> is the gateway to
     the entire PHP and Zend APIs. <var class="filename">php_ini.h</var> adds the APIs
     for runtime configuration (INI) entries. Not all extensions will use this.
     Finally, <var class="filename">ext/standard/info.h</var> imports the
     aforementioned <span class="function"><a href="function.phpinfo.html" class="function">phpinfo()</a></span> utility API.

     wants to be built as a dynamically loadable module instead of being
     statically linked into PHP. <strong><code>ZEND_GET_MODULE</code></strong> defines a
     tiny function which Zend can use to get the extension&#039;s
     <em>zend_module_entry</em> at runtime.

      The astute reader who has peeked into

      counter module enabled statically may have noticed that there is also a
      <strong><code>HAVE_COUNTER</code></strong> constant defined that the source code
      doesn&#039;t check for. There&#039;s a simple reason this check isn&#039;t done: It&#039;s
      unnecessary. If the extension isn&#039;t enabled, the source file will never be
      compiled.

The guy who commented on being unable to use C++ for writing extensions is utterly wrong. You easily can. And you can also use Fortran, naturally, which is an invaluable asset in developing advanced extensions. You just need to know how ;-) Hint: RTFM on ABI, calling conventions, and features of your favorite link editor. And remember: you ALWAYS can call object code produced by compilers of other languages from C, ABI bridging is trivial, and in many cases simplified by the toolchain itself.</span>

Comparing C to PHP is unfair since C++ has so much more than C. You can say that you would have much more if C++ could be used but since it is not you must use what C offers. I am not criticizing PHP but it seems inappropriate to make PHP appear to be better than another language in a misleading way.<br />

Go ahead and delete this if you want to but I hope the documentation is revised appropriately.</span>
